This project is a Flask-based web application that uses the OpenAI API to assist with early-stage startup ideation and validation. The application allows a user to describe a business idea and receive an automated analysis covering market potential, risks, and improvement recommendations. In addition, it can generate complete startup concepts from scratch, including a name, tagline, product description, elevator pitch, target audience, business model, and basic traction metrics.
The interface is implemented as a single-page layout rendered directly from Flask using an embedded HTML template. It provides two main workflows: analyzing an existing idea and generating a new startup concept. Users can add contextual tags to their idea, switch between analysis and generation modes, and view structured results without page reloads through asynchronous API requests.
The backend is written in Python and exposes several JSON endpoints. These endpoints communicate with the OpenAI Chat Completions API to perform idea analysis, competitor research, and startup generation. When logo generation is enabled, the application also uses the OpenAI image generation API to create a simple, modern logo concept based on the generated startup identity.
The application does not require a database; all generated data is processed in memory and returned directly to the client. Configuration is minimal and limited to providing an OpenAI API key via environment variables. The project is intended for experimentation, prototyping, and educational use rather than production deployment.
To run the application locally, Python 3 and the required dependencies must be installed, and an OpenAI API key must be available in the environment. Once started, the Flask server serves the web interface on localhost and handles all generation requests internally.
